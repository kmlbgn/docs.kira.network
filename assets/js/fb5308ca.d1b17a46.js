The KIRA network acts as a decentralized middleware and infrastructure layer ensuring that applications are accessible and have the resources needed to run. As long the server application remains deterministic and can be re-executed or otherwise proven that execution happened in the expected way (e.g. by using a set of sequenced inputs, ZK proofs, or even AI) it is possible to trustlessly verify the execution and thus transition the application from one state of its database to another. Submitting state hashes of the application database into the KIRA base layer by the application leader elected in each session (database snapshot) allows for achieving consensus and thus for composability (value transfer and data communication) between the apps.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Overview":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"KIRA\u2019s base layer (SEKAI) handles governance, token transfers, multi-staking, and all other system security-related on-chain logic. At the same time, SEKAI assists in the execution of decentralized applications taking place on their dedicated off-chain subnets by enabling their orchestration, communication, and settlement. This separation enables parallel scaling of execution, storage, and networking capabilities of each application. KIRA applications, also known as RollApps, consist of an execution container defining application logic, and a verification container defining how changes in an application state can be verified.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Virtual-Finality-Gadget":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Virtual-Finality-Gadget","title":"Virtual Finality Gadget","description":"The Virtual Finality Gadget (VFG) is a programmable finality mechanism that grants each application on KIRA the ability to establish its own verification and consensus rules. It divides application logic into execution (operated by Executors) and verification (overseen by Fishermen) components. VFG allows developers to customize their finality logic, such as choosing an optimistic model of execution (rollups - valid by default), pessimistic (rolldowns - invalid until verified), or any bespoke verification logic, even allowing for the creation of recursive appchains and human judgment by a defined set of network actors. VFG\u2019s ability to support non-deterministic verification binaries makes it particularly useful for complex, blockchain-less, Web2-scale applications, such as AI and gaming as well as makes it impossible for an attacker to predict if his attack attempt would be successful as the verification rules can be customized by each Fisherman individually.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX","title":"Middleware - INTERX","description":"Overview","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Orchestrator---RYOKAI":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Orchestrator---RYOKAI","title":"Orchestrator - RYOKAI","description":"RYOKAI \u4e86\u89e3 (\u308a\u3087\u304b\u3044), previously known as KIRA Manager, is KIRA\u2019s orchestration tool, a physical infrastructure manager that facilitates backend operations of KIRA stack components for consensus nodes.

Instead, it adopts a per-capita approach, ensuring that every vote carries equal weight, irrespective of the voter\'s stake. Within this system, Consensus nodes hold a foundational role by serving as the primary decision-makers. They form the initial group of Councilors, which defines any network participants endowed with the right to propose and vote on network decisions. Anyone can become a Councilor; the group is open to all users, contingent upon receiving endorsement from the existing council.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/SEKAI/Overview":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/SEKAI/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"SEKAI (\u4e16\u754c) is KIRA\'s core blockchain, managing all on-chain logic, including processing transactions and state transitions.
